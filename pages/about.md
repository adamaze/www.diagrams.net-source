**Open-source:** The free diagrams.net online tool is supported by sales of the third-party [draw.io for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210933/draw-io-diagrams-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) and [draw.io for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211413/draw-io-diagrams-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) apps. Because it's open-source, there are a huge number of [integrations with other online tools](/integrations.html) available. Plus, when you share a diagram, you know anyone can open and edit it using diagrams.net.

**Secure and private:** The diagram editor runs in your browser so that your [diagram data stays only on your computer or mobile device](/blog/data-protection.html). You'll always be able to view and edit your diagram files with our free tool. Download the Desktop version to [diagram securely offline](/blog/diagrams-offline.html).

**Rich libraries:** Think of a type of diagram - there is probably a shape library and a template diagram that will get you started quickly. Additional free clipart images are available when you search for a word in diagrams.net online.
