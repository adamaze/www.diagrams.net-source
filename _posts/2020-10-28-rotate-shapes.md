Shapes are placed on the drawing canvas in diagrams.net using a default orientation. You can rotate shapes into another position as you need.

1. Select a shape and you'll see the rotate grab handle appear - a small circular arrow above the top right corner of the shape.

2. Click on and drag the rotate symbol around to rotate your shape to a new angle.

Alternatively, you can enter an exact angle, rotate the shape by 90 degrees on the _Arrange_ tab in the format panel on the right.

Non-symmetrical shapes can also be flipped horizontally or vertically via the _Arrange_ tab.

## Rotate multiple shapes

You can rotate multiple shapes if you group them together.

1. Select multiple shapes by holding down ``Shift`` then clicking on each shape you want to rotate.
2. Click on _Group_ on the _Arrange_ tab in the format panel, or right click and select _Group_ from the context menu, or press ``Ctrl+G`` to form a group. A selection box will surround your selected shapes and the rotate grab handle will appear.

3. Rotate your group as you would a single shape - click on the rotate symbol and drag the group to a new angle.

## Rotate the connector label text

Select the label on a connector, and use the rotate grab handle to rotate the text.

**Tip:** In some shapes, you can [change the writing direction of the labels](/doc/faq/writing-direction-change.html) from horizontal to vertical.

## Rotate a connector

Connectors do not usually have a rotate grab handle, as the path they follow between two shapes is set automatically by waypoints.

[Add waypoints to change the path of a connector](/blog/waypoints-connectors.html)

If you have a separate connector that isn't connected to a shape at either end, you can group it with another shape and rotate it.
