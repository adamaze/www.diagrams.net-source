With the diagrams.net app for Microsoft Teams, you and your team can collaborate in real time on diagrams directly from your team's channel in a Teams tab.

**Secure and private:** Your diagrams are securely stored in your linked Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive account, and in your browser or the Teams app while you are working on them. 

**Fully-featured diagramming app:** With diagrams.net in Teams, your team has an easy-to-use diagramming application for quick online whiteboard sketches through to complex diagrams: [BPMN diagrams](/blog/bpmn-2-0.html), [flowcharts](/doc/getting-started-basic-flow-chart.html), mindmaps, org charts, UML diagrams, infographics, network diagrams, mockups, rack diagrams, and many more types of diagrams.

## Introduction to the diagrams.net editor

The diagrams.net editor in Teams uses the minimal Sketch editor theme by default so it feels like an easy-to-use whiteboard. 

* A **toolbar on the left** contains the most common shapes and connectors. 
* Another **toolbar on the bottom right** allows you to move around the canvas. 
* Click the **diagrams.net logo** for the menu. The **notification bell** in the top right indicates when your diagram has auto-saved.

Further diagramming tools and options are located in **floating panels**, that are minimised or hidden by default. You can move these around the canvas to maximise your diagramming space.

### Getting started with diagrams.net in Teams

<img src="/assets/img/blog/diagrams-in-teams-tutorial.png" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="diagrams.net in Teams: A basic visual tutorial">

Drag or click on a shape, sticky note, text, or connector in the left toolbar to add it to the canvas. 

Alternatively, double click on a blank area on the canvas and select from a list of common shapes. 

When you add a shape to the canvas, start typing to add a text label. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/online-whiteboard-add-shapes.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="Add shapes from the toolbar or double click on the online whiteboard canvas and select a shape">

Click on a shape on the canvas to select it. You'll see blue dots around the shape, a blue arrow in the top right, and when you hover over the shape, four blue direction arrows. 
   * Click on one of the four blue direction arrows to add and connect a shape in that direction. 
   * Alternatively, drag a connector from one of the four direction arrows and drop it on another shape to connect them.

Drag one of the blue dots to [resize the selected shape](/doc/faq/shape-resize.html), just as you would resize an image in a document. 

Drag the arrow in the top right to [rotate the selected shape](/doc/faq/shape-rotate.html). 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/online-whiteboard-resize-rotate-move-shapes.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="Drag shapes to move them in your online whiteboard at sketch.diagrams.net or drag the grab handles to rotate or resize shapes">

Click on the three tools at the bottom of the toolbar on the left. 
   * The _Freehand_ tool opens a floating panel that lets you [draw a shape with your mouse, pen or finger](/blog/freehand-drawing.html). 
   * The _Shapes_ tool opens the shape library panel, where you can search for shapes and enable specialised shape libraries for specific types of diagrams. 
   * The _Templates_ tool opens the template manager where you can [preview, select and insert any of the many diagram templates](/blog/template-diagrams.html).

If you feel a bit lost, hover over any part of the diagrams.net app to see a tooltip.

Hold the right mouse button and drag to move the diagram canvas around. 
   * Alternatively, click on the _Outline_ tool in the bottom right to open a panel with an overview of the entire canvas. Drag the blue area in the _Outline_ panel to move to another location on the canvas quickly.

Use the mouse wheel or click on the _Zoom_ tools in the bottom right to zoom in or out. Click on the number to return to 100%.

Select a shape or connector and click on the _Format_ floating panel title. Depending on what you have selected, different options will be available.
   * **Style tab:** Change the outline and fill colours and shape styles. If you selected a connector, you can change the arrow ends and line style. 
   * **Text tab:** Change the font, text colours and size. 
   * **Arrange tab:** Set a specific angle for the rotation, or values for the shape size. Bring overlapping shapes forward or backwards on the canvas.

Click on the diagrams.net logo in the top left to export and print your diagram and set various preferences for the editor. 

**Tip:** you can right-click on the canvas or on a shape or connector to open a context menu that lets you select and manipute shapes and connectors, add links and metadata to shapes and connectors, and set various options.
