We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the vsdx import matches the original to the fullest extent possible. However, there are architectural differents in the .vsdx and .drawio modelling formats, on top of functionality differences between Windows and browser-based rendering engines.

This means that on rare occasions, your imported diagram may not render identically the same as the original diagram, or interactive behaviour attached to diagram elements may not fully match.
