There are several ways you can zoom into and out of your diagram. This only changes what you see on your monitor - your diagram will not appear zoomed in (or zoomed out) when you print or export it to an image format.

## Zoom in/out using the toolbar

* Click on _Zoom In_ or _Zoom Out_ in the toolbar above the drawing canvas.
* Click on the number to the left of the _Zoom In/Out_ magnifying glass icons in the toolbar, then select a different zoom factor from the list.

## Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom in/out

* Press ``Ctrl+Plus`` to zoom in on Windows, or ``Ctrl+Minus`` to zoom out. If you are on macOS, press ``Cmd+Plus`` or ``Cmd+Minus``.
* Hold down ``Alt`` or ``Ctrl`` and use your mouse wheel to zoom in or out.

## Zoom in/out using the menu

* Select _View > Zoom In_ or _View > Zoom Out_ in the menu.
