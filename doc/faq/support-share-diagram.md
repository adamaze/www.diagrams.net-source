When the diagrams.net support team asks you to share your diagram file with them to troubleshoot an issue, you can share it with the team via Google Drive.

1. In your Google Drive, right click on the diagram file, then select _Share_ from the context menu.
2. Enter ``support@diagrams.net`` in the text field, then click _Done_.

The support team will receive an email notification with a link to your diagram.
