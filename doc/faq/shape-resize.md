All shapes can be resized by dragging their perimeter grab handles, or by entering an exact size in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel. 

1. Select a shape or group of shapes to see round blue grab handles on its outer perimeter. 
2. Click and drag one of these grab handles to resize the shape. The corners let you resize both horizontally and vertically.

To keep shapes centered during resize, hold down ``Ctrl`` on Windows or ``Cmd`` on macOS.

**Resize group without resizing child shapes**

If you want to [resize the container that holds a group of shapes, but not resize the child shapes](/doc/faq/resize-group-disable.html) along with it, under the _Style_ tab in the format panel, expand the _Property_ list and disable the ``Resize Children`` checkbox.

## Copy and paste shape sizes

1. Select the source shape that is the size you want to use, then click _Copy Size_ in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel on the right. 
2. Select the shape or shapes that you want to be the same size, and click _Paste Size_ in the _Arrange tab.

<br />The height and width of the selected shapes will now match the one you copied, even if they are different shapes.

## Constrain proportions on resize

Some shapes, such as the circle, will keep their proportions when they resize (always remaining a circle). To [resize a shape or group of shapes and maintain their height and width](/doc/faq/shape-constrain-proportions.html), hold down ``Shift`` as you drag the grab handles.

**Tip:** You can also [autosize shapes to fit their text labels exactly](/doc/faq/autosize.html) and [rotate shapes and groups of shapes](/doc/faq/shape-rotate.html).
