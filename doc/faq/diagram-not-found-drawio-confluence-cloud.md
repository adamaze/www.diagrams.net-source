You may see a dialog that explains the following:

> Diagram Not Found: The diagram does not belong to a published page

You may see this dialog when you try to edit a diagram that has been created and attached to a page, when that page has not yet been published. It can also occur when a diagram attachment has been moved from a page.

Check that the page has been published, and is not currently a draft.

1. Go to the list of draw.io diagrams in your space.
2. Click on the diagram you want to edit.
3. Hover over the diagram to see the toolbar, then click on _Go to containing page_ to see the Confluence page that the diagram is attached to.

4. Publish your page draft.
