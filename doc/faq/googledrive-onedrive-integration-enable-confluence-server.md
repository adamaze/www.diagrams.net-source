The draw.io app for Confluence Data Center and Server allows you to embed diagrams you have stored in Google Drive and One Drive. This option is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled in the draw.io app configuration by a Confluence administrator.

1. As an administrator, go to the Confluence Administration, then select _Configuration_ under the _draw.io add-on_ section.
2. Select the _Google Drive/OneDrive Integration_ tab.
3. Select _Simple integration_ if you draw.io to communicate directly with the cloud platforms. Alternatively, if you have created an app within Google Drive/One Drive and want all communication with the cloud platforms to go via your own servers, select _Full integration_.
4. Click _Save changes_.
