The tags dialog allows you to display and hide elements of your diagram based on metadata, or tags. This can be useful for exploring complex diagrams, for example to indicate which code segments run on which system, or which department is responsible for which steps in a flow chart.

## Using tags on shapes in a diagram

Tags are a space-separated list of words stored in the tags property of a shape's properties, or metadata. Select a shape, then click _Edit > Edit Data_ to see a shape's properties (or right-click and select _Edit Data_ or press ``Ctrl+M``).

### See what tags have been applied

When you hover over a shape, the tag will appear as a tooltip.

Alternatively, you can look at shape's properties. Select a shape, then press ``Ctrl+M``.

#### Show and hide shapes based on their tags

If you know the names of the tags, you can use the Tags dialog to hide shapes based on their tags or show hidden shapes.

1. Click _Extras > Tags_.
2. Type the name of the tag, and click _Hide_ or _Show_.
