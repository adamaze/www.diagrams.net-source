You can reposition the text labels of shapes and connectors easily using the _Position_ tool in the format panel. The text can be positioned outside the shapes, at the top, right, bottom, and left, as well as different alignments within those positions.

1. Select the shapes or connectors where you want to change the label position.
2. In the _Text_ tab of the format panel on the right, select a new _Position_ from the drop down list.
