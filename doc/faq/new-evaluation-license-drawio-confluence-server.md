You can generate up to three evaluation licenses for Confluence Server apps. If your draw.io evaluation license has expired you can get a new evaluation license through Atlassian.

1. Go to [https://my.atlassian.com/products](https://my.atlassian.com/products) and log in with the account that has the evaluation license that just expired.
2. In the list of licenses or SENs on that page, find and expand the entry for _draw.io Diagrams for Confluence: Trial_.
3. Underneath the _License Key_ field, click on _New Trial License_, and follow Atlassian's instructions. Copy the license key that you are given.
4. As an administrator in your Confluence instance, click on the gear icon in the menu, then select _Manage apps_.
5. Expand the _Draw.io Confluence Plugin_ section, paste your copied license key into the License Key field, then click Update.

## Get a new license via the Atlassian Marketplace

2. Click on _Try it free_, make sure _Server_ is selected, then click _Start free trial_.
3. Enter your organisation's details, then click _Generate License_.
4. Copy the license key, and paste it into the _License Key_ field in the _Draw.io Confluence Plugin_ section on the _Manage apps_ page in your Confluence administration area.
