Use layers to add structure to your diagrams and make them interactive. 

* Select _View > Layers_ or press ``Ctrl+Shift+L`` / ``Cmd+Shift+L`` to display or hide the _Layers_ dialog.

**Tip:** By default, a new diagram has a single _Background_ layer, to which all shapes, connectors and text are added.

## Add and rename a new layer

1. Click on _Add Layer_ (``+``) at the bottom of the _Layers_ dialog.

2. Double click on the layer you just added (called Untitled Layer) to rename it. 
3. Enter the new layer's name in the text field, then click _Rename_.

To add shapes to your layer, make sure you have selected it in the _Layers_ dialog. You can also [move existing shapes and connectors to your new layer](/doc/faq/layer-move-shapes.html).

## Remove an existing layer

**Important:** Make sure you have moved the shapes and connectors you want to keep in your diagram to another layer before you delete it. Removing a layer also removes all of its contents.

1. In the _Layers_ dialog, click on the layer you want to delete so that it is highlighted blue. 
2. Click on _Remove_ (rubbish bin) at the bottom left of the _Layers_ dialog.
