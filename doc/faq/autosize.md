Autosize allows you to fit the size of your shape to the height and width of their text labels exactly.

1. Select the shapes you want to resize. If you want to resize all shapes, select _Edit > Select Vertices_ or press ``Ctrl+Shift+I`` on Windows and ``Cmd+Shift+I`` on macOS.
2. Go to the _Arrange_ tab in the format panel, and click on the _Autosize_ button.

**Tip:** Use the autosize keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+Shift+Y`` on Windows or ``Cmd+Shift+Y`` on macOS.
