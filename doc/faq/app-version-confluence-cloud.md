You can check which version of the draw.io app is currently installed in your instance, and retrieve your Support Entitlement Number (SEN).

1. While editing a draw.io diagram in your Confluence Cloud instance, select _Help > Support_ from the menu.

**Note:** You will not see a SEN if you have not licensed the draw.io app for Confluence or currently have an active trial, you will not have a SEN.

1. In this case, as an administrator, go to the Confluence Settings, and select _Manage apps_ from the left-hand navigation.
2. Expand the draw.io app information, click on the _Free trial_ button and wait until your trial license is installed. Your SEN will then show on the _draw.io Support_ page.
