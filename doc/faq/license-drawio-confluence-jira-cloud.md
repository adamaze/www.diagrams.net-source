If you use draw.io in Confluence and Jira Cloud, you only need to license it in Confluence Cloud for it to work in both.

Follow the process below exactly to install draw.io in both instances. The app will then work in both your Jira Cloud and Confluence Cloud instances, but you will only be billed for the Confluence Cloud version.

## Step 1: Install draw.io in Jira Cloud
1. Go to the _Find new apps_ page in Jira Cloud - click _Settings > Apps > Find new apps_ or replace ``xyz`` with the subdomain of your instance in the following link: [``https://xyz.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/upm/marketplace/highest-rated``](https://xyz.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/upm/marketplace/highest-rated)
