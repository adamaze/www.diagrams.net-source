3. Click on _Manage Apps_ under the Atlassian Marketplace section, then expand the _draw.io_ section. If you have many apps in your instance you may need to use a filter to find draw.io in the list.

The **Version** number of the draw.io app installed in your Jira Cloud instance is in the middle panel at the top.

If you have licensed draw.io, you'll see your **Support Entitlement Number (SEN)**.

If you don't see a SEN code, then the draw.io app is currently unlicensed. Click on the _Free trial_ button and wait until your trial license is installed. The License SEN will be added License details.
