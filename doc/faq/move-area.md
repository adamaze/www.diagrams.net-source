You can quickly [move an entire area of your diagram with a shortcut](/blog/shortcut-move-area.html) that was previously known as the scissors tool.

1. Hold down ``Ctrl+Shift`` on Windows or ``Cmd+Shift`` on macOS.
2. Click on a blank section of the drawing canvas and drag it to move it. Guide lines will show you the origin and displacement of the area you are moving.

Any shapes _fully_ within the area will move to match how far you dragged the drawing canvas, and connectors will reroute automatically.
