Instead of styling all of the shapes and connectors in your diagram individually, you can apply colour schemes to your entire diagram. 

These global style schemes will be applied to shapes, text, connectors, the diagram's background colour and grid.

1. Select the _Style_ tab in the format panel when nothing is selected in your diagram. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/diagram-style-templates.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Update the style of your diagram's background, shapes and connectors in one step">
2. Choose from one of the schemes (over two pages) to update the styles of the diagram background as well as all shapes and connectors in one click. Hover over the style to see a preview. 
3. Use the checkboxes to change the style of connectors to _Curved_, select _Rounded_ to round the corners of all rectangles, or apply the rough [_Sketch_ style](/blog/rough-style.html).

Click _Reset_ to reset the Style options on this tab to their defaults.
