1. Click _File > Export As > SVG_.
2. Change the export settings to suit your requirements.
   * Choose the _Zoom_ factor, set a _Border_ width around your diagram, and enable the checkboxes if you want a _Transparent Background_, a _Shadow_ on your shapes, or to include the _Grid_ of the drawing canvas. 
   * If you only want to export the shapes and connectors that are currently selected, enable the _Selection only_ checkbox. 
   * Enable _Embed Images_ to include image components, such as clip art, into the SVG.
   * Make sure the checkbox to _Include a copy of my diagram_ is selected if you want to be able to open your diagram and edit it again when you import the SVG file into diagrams.net. 
   * By default _Links_ will open following the viewer's browser preferences. Select a different behaviour if you want links to always open in a new tab or a new browser window.
