2. In the panel on the right, deselect the _Page view_ checkbox.

Alternatively, you can change the scale of the diagram and add a border around it by using the advanced export settings.

1. Click _File > Export As > Advanced_.
2. Select _PDF_ from the _Format_ drop-down list.
3. Change the export settings to suit your requirements, then click _Export_.
