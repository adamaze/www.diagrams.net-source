If you press ``Backspace`` or ``Delete`` after you have selected a shape, it will only delete that shape and not the connectors attached to it. Use a combination of a keyboard shortcut and the toolbar to delete a shape with all of the connectors to and from that shape.

1. Select the shape you want to delete.
2. Hold down ``Shift`` and click on the delete (trash can) icon in the toolbar.
