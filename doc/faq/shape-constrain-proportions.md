To maintain the ratio of the height and width whenever you resize a shape, enable the constrain proportions option.

While _Constrain Proportions_ is enabled, when you resize the shape, it will won't stretch the shape, but keep the height and width in the shape's original proportions.

1. Select the shape or shapes you want to constrain.
2. Select the _Arrange_ tab in the format panel on the right.
3. Select the _Constrain Proportions_ checkbox.

**Note:** You must set this for each individual shape you want to constrain - this option is not enabled by default.

**Keyboard shortcut:** Alternatively, hold down ``Shift`` while resizing a shape to maintain the height/width ratio.
