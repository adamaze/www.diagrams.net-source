Select _Arrange > Insert > Text_ to insert a basic text shape. This is the same as double-clicking on an empty section of the drawing canvas and select the Text shape, or dragging the Text shape from the _General_ shape library on the left. 

Select _Arrange > Insert > Link_, then enter the link you want to add in the _Edit Link_ dialog. If you want the destination to open in a new tab, click the _Open in New Window_ checkbox, then click _Insert_.
