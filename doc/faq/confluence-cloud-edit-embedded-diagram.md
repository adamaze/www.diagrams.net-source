You can embed and reuse draw.io diagrams across multiple pages in Confluence Cloud using the _Embed draw.io diagram_ macro. When you update the master diagram, wherever you have embedded that diagram will be updated automatically.

You won't be able to edit the diagram from the Confluence page when you have used the _Embed draw.io diagram_ macro. You'll need to go to the page that has the original diagram and edit it there. 

1. View the page with the embedded diagram.
2. Hover over the diagram to display the toolbar, and click on _Go to containing page_.

3. On the page with the original diagram, hover over it and click on the _Edit_ pencil in the toolbar.

**Troubleshooting**

If you don't see the toolbar, the macro is using the Simple Viewer - you'll need to [change the _Viewer Settings_](/doc/faq/confluence-cloud-viewer-settings.html) of that _Embed draw.io diagram_ macro. 

Alternatively, find and edit the original diagram via the full list of all draw.io diagrams in your current space via the left panel.
