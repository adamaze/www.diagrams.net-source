To find which layer a shape is on, you need to have the _Layers_ dialog open.

1. Select _View > Layers_ to open the _Layers_ dialog, if it isn't already open.
2. Select the shape, then click on the _Move selection to_ icon, the box with an arrow going down into it, in the _Layers_ dialog.

The layer with the check mark next to it is the layer that the shape is on.
