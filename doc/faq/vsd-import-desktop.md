The Desktop version of diagrams.net is a standalone application which does not send any data outside of your device.

Therefore, Desktop is unable to import .vsd files directly, as this import requires functionality that is only available on our servers.

As a workaround, use the online version of diagrams.net to import the file and save it to your device. Then you can continue working on the diagram file in the Desktop app.

## Convert a .vsd diagram file to .drawio

1. Go to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net)
2. Drag and drop the .vsd file onto the drawing canvas, and diagrams.net will automatically import it.
3. Select _File > Save_ from the menu, change the filename if necessary, then select _Device_ as the target.
4. Open the file as normal in your diagrams.net Desktop app.
