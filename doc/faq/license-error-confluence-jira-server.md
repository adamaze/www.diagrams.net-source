You may see a  error on all draw.io diagrams in your Confluence or Jira Server or DC instance in the following situations.

**Expired license maintenance**
This error will be displayed when you have installed a version of the draw.io app after your license maintenance period has expired. To resolve this error, either:
* Install a version that was released prior to this date.
* Renew the maintenance on the draw.io app to use the latest version.

**Non-matching license tier**
If your license tier for the draw.io app is lower than the tier you have purchased for Confluence or Jira, you will see this error. To resolve this error, either:
* Increase the license tier for the draw.io app to match your host Atlassian product.
* Downgrade the license tier for your Confluence or Jira Server or DC instance to match what you have purchased for the draw.io app.

**Non-matching license type**
If your host Atlassian product's license type (Commercial, Academic, Open Source Project, Community, Classroom) does not match that of the draw.io app, you will see this error. To resolve this:
* Purchase a license of the matching type and tier for either the draw.io app, or the host Atlassian product.
