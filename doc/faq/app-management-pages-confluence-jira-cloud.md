As an administrator in your Confluence Cloud or Jira Cloud instance, you can manage the existing apps and their licenses, and add new apps via your instance's settings.

## Manage your Jira Cloud apps

In Jira Cloud, as an administrator: Click on _Settings_ (the gear icon in the lower left), then on _Apps_.

You'll be taken directly to the Find new apps page where you can search for an app, and sort/filter the search results.

Click on _Manage apps_ to work with the apps you have already installed in your instance.

Alternatively, you can jump directly to these pages. Replace ``xyz`` with the subdomain of your Jira instance:

* Manage apps in Jira Cloud - [``https://xyz.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/upm?source=side_nav_manage_addons``](https://xyz.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/upm?source=side_nav_manage_addons)
* Find new apps for Jira Cloud - [``https://xyz.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/upm/marketplace/highest-rated``](https://xyz.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/upm/marketplace/highest-rated)

## Manage your Confluence Cloud apps

It works similarly in Confluence Cloud. As an administrator: Click on _Settings_, and find the _Atlassian Marketplace_ section in the left navigation panel. Either select _Find new apps_ or _Manage apps_.
