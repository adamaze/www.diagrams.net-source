The advertising footer displayed at the bottom of the free app.diagrams.net editor online does not contain any tracking code. It will usually direct you to the [desktop build of diagrams.net](https://get.diagrams.net), which is available to download for Windows, macOS and Linux and can be used offline.

* Click on the small ``x`` in the top right of the diagrams.net footer to close it.
