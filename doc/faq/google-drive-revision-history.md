When you store your diagrams in Google Drive, diagrams.net automatically saves changes to a revision history.

1. Select _File > Revision History_ to see the various revisions.
2. Click on a tab on the left to view a particular revision. You can zoom into the preview of your diagram using the buttons below the viewer.
3. Work with the selected version of your diagram:
   * _Download_ that particular version of your diagram.
   * _Edit_ that version in a new tab in your browser.
   * _Restore_ that version of your diagram (roll back your changes), then click _OK_ to confirm.
   * _Show_ that version of your diagram in the diagrams.net lightbox in a new browser tab.
