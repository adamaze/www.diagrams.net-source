Diagramming is not like painting with brushes as if you were editing a photo. Instead, you place diagram elements then resize, rotate, and connect them together and change their styles. These elements include:
* shapes
* connectors (arrows)
* labels and text

You add these diagram elements to a drawing canvas, which uses guidelines and a grid to help you place and align the elements. The grid and guidelines aren't visible when you print or create an image of your diagram.
