Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) cover all of the ways in which we communicate with you on this website and in any related communications channels such as our feeds, social media and email. When you access our services, or sign up to hear from us, we understand that you are OK with these Terms.

This Privacy Policy details how diagrams.net collects, uses and shares information gathered from you, as well as explaining how diagrams.net diagram data is processed and stored.

diagrams.net is a trademark and draw.io is a registered trademark of JGraph Ltd. JGraph Ltd is a company registered in England that develops and owns the software, runs the diagrams.net and draw.io sites and owns the diagrams.net and draw.io brands.

We maintain various privacy and data security policies, as well as documented processes and testing results in the [/jgraph/security-privacy-legal GitHub repository](https://github.com/jgraph/security-privacy-legal)

## The information that we collect

### When you visit the our websites

Content on both the www.diagrams.net domain and the app on app.diagrams.net are both delivered via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Refer to the [Cloudflare privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for details of the information they may collect when using the sites. Diagrams.net servers do not access that information. The Cloudflare published DPA is available [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/media/pdf/cloudflare-customer-dpa.pdf).

We do not use permanent or session cookies. We [do not use Google analytics](/blog/drawio-google-analytics.html) or tracking pixels.

### When you contact us via email or on social media

You may send us information, such as your name or email address if you submit a support request or send us a direct message on our social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus).

If you have submitted a support request, we will typically contact you by email to work out a resolution to the problem.

We retain email correspondence for 6 years, after which it is routinely deleted. Direct messages sent via social media accounts are routinely deleted after 6 months.

### When you use diagrams.net to create a diagram

The [app.diagrams.net](http://app.diagrams.net/) server logs information about your device (device or browser type and IP) when you use the online application or the Trello Power-Up, to help us debug technical problems that may occur within the [diagrams.net application](http://app.diagrams.net/). This information is stored in a cyclical log where the oldest data is overwritten by current data continuously. The cycle is about 10 days. These logs contain no diagram information. Only engineering staff are permitted access to server logs to resolve issues. No non-technical staff are permitted access, either directly or indirectly.

#### Diagram data storage

diagrams.net is as fully a client-side application as is technically possible – diagrams.net does not store your diagram data. When you choose to store your diagram on your local filesystem, localStorage in your browser, or in Google Drive, your diagram data and your preferences do not travel through our servers. Diagram data stored in the following applications and cloud services are covered by their respective privacy policies:

- Confluence or Jira – [Atlassian’s privacy policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy)
- Google Drive – [Google’s privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

No personal information, or information stored is made available to JGraph when you use diagrams.net online, offline or within any of its integrations.

#### When you change your diagram’s sharing permissions

If you use Google Drive, you are permitted to change the permissions of your diagram. This sharing permissions dialog is entirely provided and served by Google.

#### When you export to a raster or PDF format

Your diagram data may be securely sent to our image export servers and the resulting file returned when you export your diagram to a PDF.
#### When errors occur

If an error condition occurs whilst using the application, the application may send an error report back to the servers. This report contains the program line and condition that occurred. Such reports contain no personal information or parts of your diagram data, nor do they contain any substantial information regarding your usage of the application.

#### When you search for shapes

No data is transmitted from your server or client browser when you use diagrams.net to any third-party with one exception: When you search for an shape, if your keyword has no results in the list of local shapes, the keyword and the list of matching shapes is sent securely to app.diagrams.net. No diagram information, nor any information about you or your system or infrastructure is transmitted.

### Request access to, modify and delete your information

If you want to access, review or delete your personal information and communication prior to the routine deletion periods described above, please send an email to [privacy@jgraph.com](privacy@jgraph.com). We will retain your request for modification or deletion as a record of our compliance with the GDPR.
